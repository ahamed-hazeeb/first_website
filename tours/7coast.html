					<h4></h4>
					<p>Leave the airport and head off towards the down south. Distances in between locations in Sri Lanka are not that long far but the time taken by road to reach a destination an experience. The 146km drive from the Colombo airport takes you through the city centre of Colombo, the coastal city of Mount Lavinia and the resort towns of Wadduwa, Kalutara, Beruwela, Bentota, Kosgoda, Ambalangoda, Hikkadduwa and finally Galle. The sights and sounds on this drive down with the sea on one side almost all the way and the domestic and commercial everyday life on the other makes the journey to Galle enriching and vibrant. The bullock carts and the buses, the lorries and the tuk tuks (trishaws), the smiles of the school children in their shining whites all a merry sight and a sort of a warm welcome to the easy going ways of the Sri Lankan people. When you eventually arrive in Galle you will check into your hotel.

					<h4>Morning</h4>
					<p>​At leisure or go for Dolphin & Whale Watching boat ride in the sea off Mirrissa (Dondara) located just 40 minutes drive from your hotel. The best time to spot Blue whales off the coast of Sri Lanka is between December and April. The largest living animal on earth, Blue whales can grow up to 100 feet (30 metres) long and weigh almost 200 tons. They are among the Earth’s longest-lived animals with an average lifespan of around 80 to 90 years. When breathing, Blue whales emit a spectacular single-column spout up to 12 metres into the air. They also typically raise their shoulders and blowholes much higher out of the water than other big whales when surfacing to breathe. These two characteristics make Blue whale watching an incredible experience.

					<h4>Afternoon
</h4>
					<p>​​The most enjoyable way to experience the Galle Fort is by walking. A leisurely walk leads past the old Dutch Church, the Governor’s house, the spice warehouses, Court Square, the Kacheri (town hall), the lighthouse and on to the sea wall and ramparts. Visit the mosque and meander down streets leading to cricket fields, the temple, and the old District Judge’s house surrounded by ancient frangipani trees.Historically, the fortified town of Galle has been a significant trading port. More than 1,000 years ago it was the essential port of call for Chinese, Persian, Arab and Indian traders. Later the Javanese and Sumatrans came, followed by Marco Polo in 1299 AD. It was with the arrival of the Portuguese in 1505 AD that a small foreign trading post was established. When the Kingdom of Kandy forced the Portuguese out of their Colombo fort in 1589 AD, a Portuguese settlement commenced in earnest with a fort of palm trees and mud.
