	<h3>The Dambulla Cave Temple- The largest temple complex in Sri Lanka</h3>
	<p>The most popular among the best places to visit in Sri Lanka is the Dambulla cave temple. It tops the Sri
Lanka tourist destinations. The largest temple complex in Sri Lanka, its statues and paintings date back to
12th Century AD. The temple complex has five rooms of different sizes; all rooms have Buddha in a different
position looking calm and peaceful. The temple is built on a black rocky mountain which serves as a nice
contrast with the white walls of the temple. Don’t miss the view from the top. The temple can be easily
accessed from both Colombo and Kandy.</p>

	<h3>Yala National Park- Among the top tourist attractions in Srilanka</h3>
	<p>Missing Yala National Park while Sri Lanka sightseeing might bring regret to wildlife lovers. It is home to a
host of wildlife and birds – you are bound to run into a group of elephants bathing in streams, tossing their
trunks wildly or leopards nestling lazily on tree branches. You could opt for the safari drives or a nature trail
among the thick green foliage of the forest. Some tourists also camp at Yala and enjoy barbeque under the
stars. Yala is the perfect place to try your hand at wildlife photography.
Getting to Yala National Park is quite simple. All you will have to do is drive down to the Park from Colombo.
Another way is by taking a bus to Tissamaharama.</p>

	<h3>Arugam Bay- Turquoise heaven for adrenaline-junkies</h3>
	<p>Sri Lanka has a coastline of over 1600 km and is ideally suited for windsurfing, speed boating, and other
water sports. Arugam Bay has azure skies and slanting coconut trees. If you are looking to surf in turquoise
waters, Arugam Bay must be in your list of must-see tourist places in Sri Lanka. It is on the southeast coast
around 320 km from Colombo.
It is the ideal place to sip coconut water, take in the scent of jasmine and allow the southern sun to tan your
skin</p>

	<h3>Sigiriya and Polonnaruwa- Ruggedness amidst the greenery</h3>
	<p>Sigiriya or the mount of remembrance is a World Heritage Site and one of the most stunning places to see in
Sri Lanka. This giant formation of rock rises out of nowhere towering over everything in its vicinity. It is quite
a climb to the top but once up there you will get to see a panoramic view of the nearby sights and the Sigiriya
fort. The rock fortress is a slice of history perched on a rock and is really worth a visit.
Not much is heard and said about Polonnaruwa, but this ancient city is no less than the Petra of the south. A
gem among Sri Lanka tourist attractions, this ancient ruined city stands amidst its erstwhile sturdy columns
and architecture. The best way to explore this ancient city is to hire a bike and zoom around the ruins. The
site is well maintained and is a telling example of Sri Lanka’s history and culture. Polonnaruwa can be easily
accessed via Sigiriya. You can take a tuk-tuk or a bus from Sigiriya. Or you can take a bus from Dambulla to
Polonnaruwa.

<h3>Galle- A 16th century marvel</h3>
<p>Galle is an important city in Sri Lanka and is a one-stop destination wherein you can take in all sights and
sounds. One of the best places to visit in Sri Lanka is the Galle Fort. The Galle Fort area has wide
cobblestoned roads and a number of eateries and cafes. Try and catch the sunset while you are there. There
are a number of trinket shops and galleries that you can visit.
Another picturesque destination for sightseeing in Sri Lanka is the Japanese Peace Pagoda. Quite close to
the Unawatuna beach, it is a white dome of serenity.</p>

	<h3>Jaffna- Peep into the past</h3>
	<p>Although a bit crowded, the temple Nallur Kovil is a nice pick among the best places to see in Sri Lanka.
Another place of interest is the Jaffna Fort. This fort is in the center of the city and is a tourist hub. If you’re in
Jaffna, you cannot miss the Nagadipa Purana Vihara, the temple can be accessed by boat. One of calmest
among Sri Lanka tourist attractions, the temple is surreal and a wonderful place to meditate.</p>
