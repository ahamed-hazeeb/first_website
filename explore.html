<h3>Anuradhapura</h3>
<p>Anuradhapura is one of the ancient capitals of Sri Lanka, famous for its
well-preserved ruins of ancient Lankan civilization. From the 4th century
BC, it was the capital of Sri Lanka until the beginning of the 11th
century AD. During this period it remained one of the most stable and
durable centers of political power and urban life in South Asia. The
ancient city, considered sacred to the Buddhist world, is today
surrounded by monasteries covering an area of over sixteen square
miles (40 km²). Anuradhapura is also significant in Hindu legend as the
fabled capital of the Asura King Ravana in the Ramayana.</p>

<h3>Arugambay</h3>
<p>Arugam Bay is a bay situated on the Indian Ocean in the dry zone of
Sri Lanka's southeast coast. The bay is located 320 km due east of
Colombo. It is a popular surfing and tourist destination. Due to its
popularity among low budget tourists, the area has managed a slow
recovery. By private initiatives only. The main road through town has still
not been repaved. Work is in progress to improve road access to the
area. But in Arugam Bay itself, little has changed. As late as May, 2009
no help has been received from any official source or international
organizations. An exception is uncoordinated support for fishing folk as
well as many school rebuilding programs, resulting in a continuation to
provide only separatist schools for each community.</p>

	<h3>Colombo</h3>
	<p>The name "Colombo", first introduced by the Portuguese in 1505, is
believed to be derived from the classical Sinhalese name Kolon thota,
meaning "port on the river Kelani". It has also been suggested that the
name may be derived from the Sinhalese name Kola-amba-thota
which means "Harbour with leafy mango trees". Due to its large
harbour and its strategic position along the East-West sea trade routes,
Colombo was known to ancient traders 2,000 years ago. However it
was only made the capital of the island when Sri Lanka was ceded to
the British Empire in 1815, and its status as capital was retained when
the nation became independent in 1948. In 1978, when administrative
functions were moved to Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte, Colombo was
designated as the commercial capital of Sri Lanka.</p>

	<p>Despite its natural beauty, the western peninsular area of KALPITIYA in
the Puttalam district of Sri Lanka is remarkably untouched by tourism.
But for those lucky enough to visit, there's a plethora of things to see
and do! With the small close-knit fishing community dominating the
lives of the local people, visitors can get a real insight into working life
away from the city. After watching the night fishing boats return in the
morning, a visit to one of the fish markets offers the opportunity to
choose the evening meal direct from the fresh catch! The Dutch Fort
and St Peter's Kerk church in the town itself are interesting examples of
Sri Lanka's rich history and colonial past. Leisurely boat rides up the
lagoon and canoe trips down the river are a pleasant way of exploring
the coastline, whilst 4WD jeep rides along the deserted sand dunes
between the ocean and the lagoon offer a unique way of watching
the colourful evening sunsets.</p>

used by women since ancient times in Sri Lanka.

eight spices in all. The best place to buy spices is at

must. Don’t forget to grab some Ceylon cinnamon –
it’s the best in the world.
